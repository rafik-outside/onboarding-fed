# Outside Sage Framework #

* Install Sage Local Wp and update custom preferences settings
* Create New Wordpress site 
* All WP files will be now - local site/app/public folder
* Clone this boilerplate to and replce all the files into public folder except wp-config.php
* On the first go we must need to change theme folder name from sage10 to project based name.
   * Inside package.json file, replace sage10 with project based name.
* Open shell using localwp 
* and go to theme folder using command `` cd wp-content/themes/themeName ``
* From theme folder run composer using command `` composer install `` - This will install all the package dependecies that we needs to run sage framework
* Now we need to install packages for asset building using command `` yarn `` from theme folder. Note - **Node version must be >= 16**
* From base theme folder (sage10 || project name)  run `` yarn prepare `` to add husky.
